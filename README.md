This is a university project designed to simulate the core operations of a real-world banking system. Developed using C++, the Qt framework for the GUI, and SQLite for data storage, it allows users to:

1. Register and log in securely

2. Check account balances

3. Transfer funds to other users

4. View detailed transaction history

5. Update profile settings (password and email)

The goal of this project was to apply Object-Oriented Programming principles, strengthen GUI development skills, and integrate a lightweight database system for persistent data handling.
